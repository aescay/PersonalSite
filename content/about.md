Hi I'm Andrew Escay. I am learning, working, and playing with data in the pursuit of becoming a professional data scientist! 

### What's This Blog For?
I decided to create this blog to help me reinforce my learning as I gain more skills relevant to the data industry. I hope to make it a **platform to help people learn the skills to build holistic data infrastructure systems within an organization** - ranging from engineering, analytics, and science applications. 

I would guess that most of my posts will have something to do with the application of a specific technology and a use case. However, every now and then, don't be surprised to see a post related to approaches, opinion pieces, or data related news!

### Skills & Technologies:
Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Project Management, Public Speaking

### Background
I've worked on various data science and analytics problems across 5 different organizations (research institutions, startups, and corporations). 

My skills mainly come from the experiences mentioned above, and I complement that learning by taking various online courses and attenting seminars and conferences. 

In university, I held positions in the leadership team of 2 innovative student organizations:

* [UP Dashboard](http://www.updashboard.com/) - Lead Data Analyst
* [UP Bike Share](https://www.facebook.com/upbikesharing/) - Chief Financial Officer 


I also dabbled in a couple hackathons:

* [P&G Moonshot](https://www.facebook.com/PandGcareersPh/posts/10156118437645970) - Champion
* [Inquirer Hack the CBD](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/791163/up-bike-share-program-wins-urban-mobility-tilt) - Champion

as well as marketing and business case competitions:

* [PANAnaw IMC 2017](http://vsb.upd.edu.ph/news/upvsbbagsback-to-backchampionshipatthe18thpananawawards) - Champion
* L'Oreal Brandstorm - National Best Speaker 2017
