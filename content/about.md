My name is Andrew Escay. I am learning, working, and playing with data in the pursuit of becoming a professional data scientist! 

### What's This Blog For?
I decided to create this blog to help me reinforce my learning as I gain more skills relevant to the data industry. I hope to make it a **platform to help people learn the skills to build holistic data infrastructure systems within an organization** - ranging from engineering, analytics, and science applications. 

I would guess that most of my posts will have something to do with the application of a specific technology and a use case. However, every now and then, don't be surprised to see a post related to approaches, opinion pieces, or data related news!

### Skills & Technologies:
Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Project Management, Public Speaking

### Background
I've worked on various data science and analytics problems across 5 different organizations (research institutions, startups, and corporations). 

My skills mainly come from the experiences mentioned above, and I compliment that learning by taking various online courses and attenting learning seminars and conferences. 

In university I held positions in the leadership team of 2 innovative student organizations:

* UP Dashboard - Lead Data Analyst
* UP Bike Share - Chief Financial Officer 


I also dabbled in a couple hackathons:

* P&G Moonshot - Champion
* Inquirer Hack the CBD - Champion,

as well as marketing and business case competitions:

* PANAnaw IMC 2017 - Champion
* L'Oreal Brandstorm - National Best Speaker 2017
